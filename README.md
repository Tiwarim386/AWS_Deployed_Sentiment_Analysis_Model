# Deployed_Sentiment_Analysis_Model




## Future Tasks to make the project Stand Out

### 1 MAKE A BETTER WEB APP
   The web app in this project simply reports to the user whether the predicted sentiment was positive or negative. thinking of a better web app that uses the same model?

### 2 IMPROVE THE WEB APP APPEARANCE
   The provided web app is very simple and there is plenty of room for improvement h to stretch my web developer skills. Making a better front end and overall a better web-app.

### 3 IMPROVE THE MODEL
   The model chosen here is a straightforward RNN with a single hidden layer. There are many different model architectures that you could try to see if they improve the results. Will read research papers for better architectures and hyperparameters and then implementing them to improve the model.
